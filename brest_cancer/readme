3.Build and Train the model using SVM
Using SVM (Support Vector Machines) we build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to predict whether the samples are benign or malignant.

4.Flask Creation
Python app.py 

Breast_Cancer_Detection.ipynb — This contains code for the machine learning model to predict cancer based on the class.
app.py — This contains Flask APIs that receives cells details through GUI or API calls, computes the predicted value based on our model and returns it
templates & static — This folders contains the HTML template and CSS styling to allow user to enter cells details and displays the predicted output.
5.Backend creation using model.pkl file
Use this pretrained model and connect it with our Flask application. Use this for prediction for model and to show the output

6. Adding form to flask app
7.Integrating web application with machine learning backend.
8. Deployment on Heroku
